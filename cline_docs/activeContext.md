# Active Context

## Current Focus

Verified no cyclic dependencies exist in the codebase

## Recent Analysis (2024)

1. Dependency Structure:
   - ✅ No cyclic dependencies found
   - ✅ processor → utils (one-way dependency)
   - ✅ shared module properly isolated
   - ✅ TYPE_CHECKING used correctly

2. Key Components:
   - shared/progress.py handling progress tracking
   - utils package providing core utilities
   - processor package consuming utils functionality

## Architecture Status

- ✅ Clean dependency structure
- ✅ Proper use of TYPE_CHECKING
- ✅ Effective separation of concerns
- ✅ Shared functionality properly isolated

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring for new cyclic dependencies
- Consider moving more shared functionality to shared package if needed
- Maintain current clean architecture patterns
