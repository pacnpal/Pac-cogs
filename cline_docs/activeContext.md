# Active Context

## Current Focus

Cyclic dependency between processor and utils packages has been resolved

## Changes Made

1. Created new shared module for progress tracking:
   - Created videoarchiver/shared/progress.py
   - Created videoarchiver/shared/__init__.py
   - Implemented centralized progress tracking functionality

2. Updated dependencies:
   - Removed processor import from compression_manager.py
   - Updated compression_manager.py to use shared.progress
   - Verified no remaining circular imports

## Architecture Improvements

- Better separation of concerns with shared functionality in dedicated module
- Eliminated cyclic dependencies between packages
- Centralized progress tracking for better maintainability

## Current Status

- ✅ Cyclic dependency resolved
- ✅ Code structure improved
- ✅ No remaining circular imports
- ✅ Functionality maintained

## Next Steps

- Monitor for any new cyclic dependencies
- Consider moving other shared functionality to the shared package if needed
