# Active Context

## Current Focus

Completed investigation of cyclic dependencies in the videoarchiver module, particularly in the processor directory.

## Active Files

- videoarchiver/processor/core.py
- videoarchiver/processor/message_handler.py
- videoarchiver/processor/queue_handler.py
- videoarchiver/processor/cleanup_manager.py

## Recent Changes

Analysis completed:

- Identified and documented dependency patterns
- Verified TYPE_CHECKING usage
- Confirmed effective circular dependency management

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Analyzed imports in processor directory
2. ✓ Mapped dependencies between components
3. ✓ Identified circular import patterns
4. ✓ Documented findings and recommendations

## Conclusion

The codebase effectively manages potential circular dependencies through:

1. Strategic use of TYPE_CHECKING
2. Late initialization
3. Forward references
4. Clear component boundaries

No immediate refactoring needed as current implementation follows best practices.
