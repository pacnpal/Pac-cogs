# Active Context

## Current Focus

Verified no cyclic dependencies exist in the codebase (2024 verification)

## Recent Analysis (2024)

1. Dependency Structure:
   - ✅ No cyclic dependencies found
   - ✅ TYPE_CHECKING used correctly in VideoProcessor
   - ✅ Clean handler initialization pattern
   - ✅ Proper dependency direction maintained

2. Key Components:
   - VideoProcessor using late initialization
   - MessageHandler with clean imports
   - QueueHandler with proper separation
   - Utils package properly isolated

## Architecture Status

- ✅ Clean dependency structure verified
- ✅ Proper use of TYPE_CHECKING
- ✅ Effective separation of concerns
- ✅ Shared functionality properly isolated

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring for new cyclic dependencies
- Consider implementing dependency injection container
- Maintain current clean architecture patterns
