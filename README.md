# Pac-cogs - Red Discord Bot Cogs Collection

Welcome to **Pac-cogs**, a collection of custom cogs for [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). These cogs are designed to add extra functionality to your RedBot instance on Discord.

## Cogs Overview

| Cog Name   | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Birthday** | Assigns a special birthday role to users and sends a celebratory message with random cake or pie emojis. Automatically removes the birthday role at midnight, with a configurable timezone. Offers the option to set a specific announcement channel and restricts usage to specified roles. Users can assign the role without needing a higher role in the hierarchy. |
